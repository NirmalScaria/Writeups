# About
Codathon was conducted on HackerEarth as part of Version21 by NIT Trichy and it had 2 rounds. One long round which consisted of comparitively harder problems and the second, short round with easier problems. The questions were of diverse topics but one observable pattern was that, for each question, at least more than half of the effort was in actually understanding the question. Once some sense could be made of the question, each of them were easy to work with. In this repo, I will try to do write ups of problems that I could solve. There could of course be better solutions, these are the ones that I could come up with. Feel free to share if you have some better solutions. I will keep uploading more in this repo.
